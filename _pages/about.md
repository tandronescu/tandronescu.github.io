Thanks for stopping by at my personal website! Here is a little bit about me. I am Mechatronics Engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo. As an ambitious individual I am always looking to expand my network, learn new things and follow my passion for new technologies whether it is software, mechanically or electrically oriented. Currently I am located in the Bay Area and am actively seeking Firmware or Embedded Software/Hardware full-time roles.

While at the University of Waterloo, I undertook a variety of co-op work-term placements at companies like Union Gas, BlackBerry/QNX, eleven-x, Nuvation and Samsung Research America. I primarily worked in roles related to Firmware Engineering, Embedded Software Engineering or Research Engineering with a focus on sensors. These internships provided a multitude of experiences in both large and small companies with many different responsibilities and learning curves which has broadened my horizon as an engineer.

Some of my personal interests outside of the technology realm include the NBA, European soccer leagues, chess, ping-pong, astronomy, cryptocurrencies, trivia, working out, reading (particularly historical fiction), watching T.V. shows and playing board games. I played rep soccer for over 7 years and played chess competitively for over 10 years placing 5th in Canada + 2nd in Ontario at one point.
